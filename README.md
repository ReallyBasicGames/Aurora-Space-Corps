# Space Blast

### Description
Space Blast is a game created using a mix of [p5](https://p5js.org/) and [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/). The goal of the game is to control your factory ship, build smaller drones and fighters, and ultimately destroy your opponent's factory.

Instructions on how to play are in the game.
